### 👋 Hi there, welcome to my profile
### 👾 Let me introduce myself first

**💻 I'm Victor, a frontend developer with one year of experience building projects of all kinds in web technologies and infrastructure tools such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and frameworks/libraries like React, Redux, Tailwind, Sass; as well as Backend tools such as Node and Express. UI design with Figma, version control with Git, packaging with Webpack.**

**📚 My current knowledge was adquired by reading blogs, watching videos and practicing a lot while reading some books about the topics I found interesting. I have been learning English since 2019, and recently I'm trying to improve with resources from Platzi.**

**🍁 My favorite things in life are video-games, music and nature. Along life I've been a big lover to this tech world, from the smallest chip to the biggest servers, consoles and computers.**
