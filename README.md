**I'm currently learning technologies of Frontend Development, to create 3D models with Blender, and practicing projects from Platzi.**

**My favorite things in life are video-games, music and nature. Big love to technology, from the smallest chip to the biggest servers and computers.**

üå± JavaScript is my first programming and I've found it as a fantastic tool (React and C could be my best as well)

üí¨ Ask me about whatever you want, the world is too giant to explorer and I enjoy learning new things uwu
